This repo contains the code to my personal blog & portfolio.

The main branch mirrors a [hugo](https://gohugo.io) working directory. The theme used to build the website is a slightly modified fork of [hugo-PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) and is added as a git submodule in themes/PaperMod directory.
The forked theme can be audited [here](https://github.com/solamarpreet/PaperMod-Responsive).

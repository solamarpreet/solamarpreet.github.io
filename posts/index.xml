      <description>Hi.
Made the switch from Medium since content there is now locked behind login pages. I thought of starting this blog in order to help newcomers understand tech concepts that are not well explained or elaborated upon by other resources.
If you feel the need to contact me use any other methods available at the homepage or write to me at solamarpreet@protonmail.com</description>
